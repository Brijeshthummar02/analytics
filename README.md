## Learning Events

The various types of _learning events_ are handled by the Android receivers at [app/src/main/java/ai/elimu/analytics/receiver](app/src/main/java/ai/elimu/analytics/receiver).

A _learning event_ is an event without any corresponding testing of the student's mastery of a concept. For example; A student presses a word in a storybook and listens to its pronunciation.

  * StoryBookLearningEvent
  * WordLearningEvent
  * LetterLearningEvent

## Assessment Events

The various types of _assessment events_ are handled by the Android receivers at [app/src/main/java/ai/elimu/analytics/receiver](app/src/main/java/ai/elimu/analytics/receiver).

An _assessment event_ is an event that involves testing of whether or not the student is able to master a concept. For example; A word is sounded out, and the student is asked select the corresponding written text amongst a list of alternatives (multiple choice).

  * WordAssessmentEvent
  * LetterAssessmentEvent

## Usage Sample

```java
// Report WordLearningEvent to the Analytics application
Intent broadcastIntent = new Intent();
broadcastIntent.setPackage(BuildConfig.ANALYTICS_APPLICATION_ID);
broadcastIntent.setAction("ai.elimu.intent.action.WORD_LEARNING_EVENT");
broadcastIntent.putExtra("packageName", BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID);
broadcastIntent.putExtra("wordText", wordText);
broadcastIntent.putExtra("learningEventType", "WORD_PRESSED");
sendBroadcast(broadcastIntent);
```

For an example of an app that is reporting learning events, see https://github.com/elimu-ai/vitabu.
